what we want
- inputs, outputs, AC
similar work
- just general overviews of their inputs and outputs
- how their problems don't exactly match ours
modelling the problem
- how does a camera work
- structure from motion
- how the existing solutions use these tools to build their pipelines
getting from what we have to what we want
- our pipeline
- details about each part of it
- concrete design specification
  - overview of our final design and the hyperparams we ended up with
making sure we meet our AC
- we need an objective measurement in order to tune our hyperparams
conclusion
- a quick overview of our design
- why will it meet AC
- how it differs from existing solutions
